Determining the correct HTTP status code to send to the client involves understanding the context of the request and the outcome of processing that request. Here are some common scenarios and guidelines for selecting appropriate status codes:

1. Successful Requests
200 OK: The request has succeeded. Use this for GET requests where the resource is successfully retrieved.
201 Created: The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created. Use this for POST requests where a new resource is created.
204 No Content: The request has succeeded, but there is no content to send in the response. Use this for DELETE requests or when the server has successfully processed the request but there is no additional information to send back.

2. Client Errors
400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication. Use this when authentication is needed but has not been provided or is invalid.
403 Forbidden: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it. Use this when the user does not have the necessary permissions for the resource.
404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource. Use this when the resource does not exist.
422 Unprocessable Entity: The request is well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors. Use this for validation errors in a request payload.

3. Server Errors
500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Use this for general server errors.
502 Bad Gateway: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded.
